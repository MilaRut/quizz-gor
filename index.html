        <br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        Finally someone let me out of my cage<br>
        Now time for me is nothin', 'cause I'm countin' no age<br>
        Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared<br>
        I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare<br>
        Intangible (ah y'all), bet you didn't think<br>
        So I command you to, panoramic view (you)<br>
        Look, I'll make it all manageable<br>
        Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews<br>
        Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?<br>
        Picture you getting down in a picture tube<br>
        Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional? Mystical? Maybe<br>
        Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view<br>
        When you're too crazy<br>
        Lifeless to those the definition for what life is<br>
        Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shift<br>
        Did you like it? Gut smokin' righteous with one toke<br>
        You're psychic among knows possess you with one go<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        The future (that's right) is coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on</p>
      <p>The essence, the basics without did you make it?<br>
        Allow me to make this childlike in nature<br>
        Rhythm, you have it or you don't<br>
        That's a fallacy, I'm in them<br>
        Every sprouting tree, every child of peace<br>
        Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes<br>
        I see destruction and demise<br>
        Corruption in the skies (that's right)<br>
        From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies<br>
        Through Russel, not his muscles<br>
        But percussion he provides<br>
        For me as a guide, y'all can see me now<br>
        'Cause you don't see with your eye<br>
        You perceive with your mind, that's the inner (fuck 'em)<br>
        So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor<br>
        Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember<br>
        Where the thought is, I brought all this<br>
        So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)<br>
        Feeling sensations that you thought was dead<br>
        No squealing and remember that it's all in your head<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        The future is coming on<br>
        I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
        I got sunshine in a bag<br>
        I'm useless but not for long<br>
        My future is coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        My future<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, my future<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, my future<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        My future<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        My future<br>
        It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on<br>
        My future
